Me : what are the updated 2026 projections?

===========================================

### Updated 2026 Projections for Key Economic and Market Parameters

Based on the latest capital market assumptions (CMAs) from major financial institutions (as of late 2025/early 2026 reports), here are updated projections relevant to your retirement modeling code. These are forward-looking 10-year estimates for U.S.-focused assets, drawing from sources like J.P. Morgan, PGIM, BNY Mellon, Schwab, Northern Trust, Verus, and others. I've focused on parameters matching your code: real mean return (for equities or a balanced portfolio), real volatility (standard deviation), inflation mean, and inflation volatility.

Projections vary by firm due to different methodologies (e.g., some emphasize AI productivity gains, while others factor in tariffs and fiscal risks). I've averaged key figures where possible for a balanced view, assuming a moderately aggressive portfolio (e.g., 60-80% equities, given your code's 15% volatility aligning with stock-heavy mixes). All returns are annualized and geometric unless noted; real returns are nominal minus expected inflation.

#### Key Updates and Suggested Code Values
- **Inflation Mean (INFLATION_MEAN)**: Most firms project U.S. CPI settling around the Fed's 2% target but with persistent pressures (e.g., from tariffs, wages, and supply chains) keeping it slightly higher. Average: ~2.5%.
  - Suggested: Keep at `0.025` or update to `0.024` (Schwab's view).
- **Inflation Volatility (INFLATION_VOL)**: Rarely specified explicitly, but historical data and implied risks (e.g., trade frictions) suggest year-to-year variability of 1-2%. No major changes from your current value.
  - Suggested: Keep at `0.015` (1.5%).
- **Real Mean Return (REAL_MEAN_RETURN)**: Your code's 7% real is optimistic compared to 2026 outlooks, which reflect high valuations depressing future equity returns. For U.S. large-cap equities: Nominal ~6.0-6.8% (average 6.3%), real ~3.5-4.3% (average 3.8%). For a 60/40 stock-bond portfolio: Nominal ~6.0-6.5% (average 6.2%), real ~3.5-4.0% (average 3.7%).
  - Suggested: Update to `0.038` for equity-heavy (real 3.8%) or `0.037` for balanced (if your vol implies 60/40).
- **Real Volatility (REAL_VOLATILITY)**: Aligns well with historical/forward estimates for equities (15-16%). For bonds: ~5%; for 60/40: ~11%.
  - Suggested: Keep at `0.15` (15%) if equity-focused; lower to `0.11` (11%) for balanced.

#### Detailed Projections by Asset Class and Source
Here's a table summarizing 10-year forward projections (nominal unless noted as real). I've included arithmetic/geometric where available (geometric is more relevant for compounding in your Monte Carlo). Volatilities are standard deviations.

| Parameter / Asset Class | J.P. Morgan | PGIM | BNY Mellon | Schwab | Northern Trust | Verus | Average / Notes |
|-------------------------|-------------|------|------------|--------|----------------|-------|-----------------|
| **U.S. Inflation Mean** | 2.5% | 2.5% | ~2.5% (implied) | 2.4% | ~2.0% (nearing targets) | 2.7% | **2.5%**; Higher than pre-2020 norms due to fiscal and trade risks. No specific volatility updates; assume your 1.5% holds. |
| **U.S. Large-Cap Equities (Nominal Return)** | 6.7% (geometric) | 5.2% | 7.6% | 5.9% | 6.8% (arithmetic/geometric) | 6.5% arithmetic / 5.4% geometric | **6.3% geometric**; Real: ~3.8% (after 2.5% inflation). Lower than historical (e.g., 10%) due to high valuations. |
| **U.S. Aggregate Bonds (Nominal Return)** | ~5.0% (implied from Treasuries/credit) | 4.7% | 4.3% | 4.8% | 5.0% (arithmetic/geometric) | 4.8% arithmetic / 4.7% geometric | **4.8% geometric**; Real: ~2.3%. Supported by elevated yields and expected rate normalization. |
| **60/40 Portfolio (60% Equities / 40% Bonds, Nominal Return)** | 6.4% (geometric) | N/A | N/A | N/A | ~6.3% (implied) | 6.3% arithmetic / 5.7% geometric | **6.2% geometric**; Real: ~3.7%. Steady but below historical averages. |
| **Volatility (Std Dev)** | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | Equities: 15.5%; Bonds: 4.9%; 60/40: 11.0% | **15% for equities** (matches your code); 11% for 60/40. No real-specific vol; use nominal as proxy. |

#### Key Themes from 2026 Reports
- **Optimism on Bonds**: Higher starting yields (post-rate hikes) boost fixed income outlooks, making them more attractive for diversification.
- **Cautious on Equities**: AI productivity could lift growth (e.g., BNY's upside), but high valuations, tariffs, and slowing GDP (average ~1.9-2.0%) cap returns.
- **Inflation Risks**: Persistent above 2% (e.g., Verus's 2.7%) due to protectionism; volatility could rise if policies escalate.
- **Real vs. Nominal**: All sources provide nominal returns; real = nominal - inflation. Your code models real returns directly, so subtract the inflation mean for updates.
- **Sources of Variation**: Firms like BNY (higher returns) emphasize global/AI gains; Schwab/PGIM (lower) stress valuations. Use an average for conservatism.

If your portfolio is 100% equities, use the ~3.8% real return; for balanced, ~3.7%. To run the code with these, simply update the static finals (e.g., `REAL_MEAN_RETURN = 0.038;`). Let me know your exact asset allocation or if you want me to simulate outputs with these values!
